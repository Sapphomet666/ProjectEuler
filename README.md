# ProjectEuler
My Solutions to the first 100 Project Euler problems

Intended as a demonstration of my coding skills. The ealier problems are probably worse written than the later ones since I'm using PE to teach myself how to code.

So far I haven't done all 100 problems yet. I'll post solutions (named 'problemName.py') as I do them. 
Once I get past problem 100, I'll create a private repo for those solutions, so as to keep within their rules.
